## Knowledge Mining Bootcamp - Build a Cognitive Search Solution for business documents using Microsoft AI Platform

## About this course

In this course, you will create an enterprise search solution by applying knowledge mining to business documents like contracts, memos, presentations and images. You will use Microsoft Azure AI technology to extract insights from unstructured data and expose the results in a Bot interface. This training is two days, but you can compress the duration with [alternative agendas](./resources/md-files/alternative-agendas.md).

## Goals

At the end of this training you will have learned:

+ **What** Azure Cognitive Search is
+ **How** to implement a Cognitive Search Solution
+ **Why** this technology can be useful for any company
+ **When** to use this solution for demos, POCs and other business scenarios

The hands-on labs will teach you how to use Microsoft Azure Search combined with Microsoft Cognitive Services for entity recognition, image analysis, text translation and indexed search on enterprise business documents. This approach uses Artificial Intelligence to create an advanced search experience.

While this course focuses on Azure Cognitive Search capabilities, an in-depth course on building Bots and integrating various Azure Cognitive Services is available here - [Azure Cognitive Services Bootcamp](https://azure.github.io/LearnAI-Bootcamp/emergingaidev_bootcamp).

In this course we will cover these key concepts:

1. Fundamentals of Azure Search and its capabilities

1. Microsoft Cognitive Search and its key business scenarios

1. Building an enrichment data pipeline for search using predefined and custom skillsets:

    + Text skills like entity recognition, language detection, text manipulation and key phrase extraction
    + Image skills like OCR
    + Content moderation skills to detect documents with incompliant content

1. Use the enriched data for an advanced search experience for business documents within an enterprise.

1. Expose the knowledge mining solution using a bot interface for document search and consumption.
